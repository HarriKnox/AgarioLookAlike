# Agario Look-Alike

### About the Project
This is an [Agario](http://agar.io/) look-alike. By "look-alike", I mean that this is not a clone or port, but instead just a mimicking exercise. There will be numerous differences between this project and the actual game, the biggest being functionality. The game is (as a game is intended to be) played by humans, wheras this look-alike simply emulates the basic movements of the entities in-game with no human interaction.

### Built with [Processing 2.2.1](https://processing.org/)
You will need to download Processing and add `processing.core` to your classpath in order to compile this. `processing.core`can be found in the downloaded zip file under `processing-x.x.x/core/library/core.jar` where the `x`s represent the version number.

### Compiling and Running
With `processing.core` in your classpath somewhere, compile all `.java` files and run `Field.java` with `java Field`.
